# Radar Triage Guide

## Data quality checks
- latest run has status field
- durationMs present and reasonable
- deliveryStatus present
- summary not empty for successful runs

## Signal-to-action mapping
For each radar signal, add:
1. Why it matters now (MENA/UAE/KSA context)
2. Potential impact (lead gen, creative, ops)
3. Next action with owner and ETA

## Escalation
Escalate when:
- 2+ consecutive failed runs
- duration spikes > 3x baseline
- no deliveries for the latest successful run
